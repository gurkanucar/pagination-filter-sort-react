# React Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting with URL Sync

### This React component provides pagination, filtering, and sorting functionality. The UI is synchronized with the URL. When you change any input and send a search request URL will update. Additionally, if you copy the link and paste it in the browser, the component will retrieve the response with the same parameters as before.
